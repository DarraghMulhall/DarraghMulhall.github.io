<h1>Big Five Personality Twitter Research</h1>

<div id="information" style="width:900px;">
    <p>Hello. My name is Darragh Mulhall. I am a 4th year computer scientist in University College Dublin. 
    For my final year project, I am researching the use of social media for predicting the personality type of 
    a user. The personality model is called the Big Five (<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits">See here</a>).</p>

    I have made this web application to collect data from the accounts of Twitter users as well as their actual personality trait scores as determined
    by the test provided, which will both be used in conjunction for analysis.

    I would be grateful if you could provide me access to your Twitter data and complete the Big Five test provided (only 20 questions).
    The data is actually publicly accessible to anyone who knows your username, 
    so it would be great if you could provide me this. The data extracted includes the posts you have made, your replies and retweets, 
    your numbers of followers and the number of users you follow, the hashtags you use, as well as the number of posts you have favourited and the number
    of favourites people have given you. 
    
    <p>An important thing to note is that the data is anonymised, meaning your name is not attached to it.
    If you are still uncomfortable with all this, you can just take the test by itself.
    </p>

    <p>By providing your username you are giving me consent to use access your Twitter Data. Thank you!</p>
